## Project Overview 
We are designing and developing a website and a Heroku app that supports an auto repair shop business. This system allows the shop's employees to post the schedule of  various auto repair services offered by the business such as regular checkups, oil changes, maintenance and glass and wheel replacements. This system also allows customers to book appointments for those services. The implementation of this system is done by 5 engineering students.
